# LUD Media Converter (adapted for Qt5)
LUD Media Converter is a simple easy to use media converter written in Python 3 and PyQt. 
It uses ffmpeg as the backend.

## General Requirements
You will need the following to run the application:
* [Python 3] (http://python.org)
* [PyQT 5] (http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)
* [FFmpeg] (http://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

## How to use
You will have ffmpeg installed.

Then run the application using the command:
$ python3 main.py

runs (for me in Mint 19) also on python 2.
